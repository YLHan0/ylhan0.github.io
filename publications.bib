abstract={Since the first report on single-layer MoS2 based transistor, rapid progress has been achieved in two-dimensional (2D) material-based atomically thin electronics, providing an alternative approach to solve the bottleneck in silicon device miniaturization. In this scenario, reliable contact between the metal electrodes and the subnanometer-thick 2D materials becomes crucial in determining the device performance. Here, utilizing the quasi-van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy of metals on fluorophlogopite mica, we demonstrate an all-stacking method for the fabrication of 2D devices with high-quality vdW contacts by mechanically transferring pre-deposited metal electrodes. This technique is applicable for complex device integration with sizes up to the wafer scale and is also capable of tuning the electric characteristics of the interfacial junctions by transferring selective metals. Our results provide an efficient, scalable, and low-cost technique for 2D electronics, allowing high-density device integration as well as a handy tool for fundamental research in vdW materials.},

abstract={Kagome superconductors AV3Sb5 (A{\thinspace}={\thinspace}K, Rb and Cs) have attracted much recent attention due to the coexistence of multiple exotic orders. Among them, the charge density wave (CDW) order has been shown to host various unconventional behaviors. Here, we investigate the CDW order by a combination of both bulk and surface doping methods. While element substitutions in bulk doping change both carriers and the crystal lattice, the surface doping primarily tunes the carrier concentration. As such, our results reveal a two-dimensional phase diagram of the CDW in doped CsV3Sb5. In the lightly bulk doped regime, the existence of CDW order is reversible by tuning the carrier concentration. But excessive bulk doping permanently destroys the CDW, regardless of the carrier doping level. These results provide insights to the origin of the CDW from both electronic and structural degrees of freedom. They also open an avenue for manipulating the exotic CDW order in Kagome superconductors.},

title={A unique van Hove singularity in kagome superconductor CsV3-xTaxSb5 with enhanced superconductivity},

month={Jun},

volume={14},
number={1},
pages={3819},
abstract={Van Hove singularity (VHS) has been considered as a driving source for unconventional superconductivity. A VHS in two-dimensional (2D) materials consists of a saddle point connecting electron-like and hole-like bands. In a rare case, when a VHS appears at Fermi level, both electron-like and hole-like conduction can coexist, giving rise to an enhanced density of states as well as an attractive component of Coulomb interaction for unconventional electronic pairing. However, this van Hove scenario is often destroyed by an incorrect chemical potential or competing instabilities. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission measurements, we report the observation of a VHS perfectly aligned with the Fermi level in a kagome superconductor CsV3-xTaxSb5 (x{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}0.4), in which a record-high superconducting transition temperature is achieved among all the current variants of AV3Sb5 (A{\thinspace}={\thinspace}Cs, Rb, K) at ambient pressure. Doping dependent measurements reveal the important role of van Hove scenario in boosting superconductivity, and spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy measurements indicate a distinct superconducting state in this system.},

abstract = {Abstract Insufficient limit of detection (LoD) toward volatile organic compounds (VOCs) hinders the promising applications of metal oxide chemiresistors in emerging air quality monitoring and/or breath analysis. There is an inherent limitation of widely adopted strategies of creating sensitive chemiresistors then operating at the optimized temperature via a continuous heating (CH) mode. Herein, a strategy combining Pt single atoms anchoring (chemical sensitization) with pulsed temperature modulation (PTM, physical sensitization) is proposed. Apart from generating abundant surface asymmetric oxygen vacancy (Pt-VO-W) active sites at pulsed high temperature (HT) stage, inward diffusion of trace target VOCs across the sensing layer at pulsed low temperature stage (driven by PTM induced concentration gradient), can greatly enhance the charge interaction probability between the generated surface active species and the surrounding VOCs, and thus offers a novel avenue on addressing the bottleneck issue of low LoD by PTM. Triggered by HT of 300 °C, the responses of Pt anchored WO3 chemiresistor to 1 ppm trimethylamine (TMA) and xylene can be drastically boosted from 1.9 (CH) to 6541.5 (PTM) and 1.5 (CH) to 1001.1 (PTM), respectively. And ultra-low theoretic LoD of 0.78 ppt (TMA) and 0.18 ppt (xylene) are successfully achieved, respectively.},

Here, we report the annihilation and creation of topological surface states in the SnTe/Crx(BiSb)2--xTe3 (CBST) heterostructures as evidenced by magneto-transport, polarized neutron reflectometry, and first-principles calculations. Our results show that topological surface states are induced in the otherwise topologically trivial two-quintuple-layers thick CBST when interfaced with SnTe, as a result of the surface state annihilation at the SnTe/CBST interface. Moreover, we unveiled systematic changes in the transport behaviors of the heterostructures with respect to changing Fermi level and thickness. Our observation of surface state creation and annihilation demonstrates a promising way of designing and engineering topological surface states for dissipationless electronics.},

abstract = {Abstract Low-energy density has long been the major limitation to the application of supercapacitors. Introducing topological defects and dopants in carbon-based electrodes in a supercapacitor improves the performance by maximizing the gravimetric capacitance per mass of the electrode. However, the main mechanisms governing this capacitance improvement are still unclear. We fabricated planar electrodes from CVD-derived single-layer graphene with deliberately introduced topological defects and nitrogen dopants in controlled concentrations and of known configurations, to estimate the influence of these defects on the electrical double-layer (EDL) capacitance. Our experimental study and theoretical calculations show that the increase in EDL capacitance due to either the topological defects or the nitrogen dopants has the same origin, yet these two factors improve the EDL capacitance in different ways. Our work provides a better understanding of the correlation between the atomic-scale structure and the EDL capacitance and presents a new strategy for the development of experimental and theoretical models for understanding the EDL capacitance of carbon electrodes.},
