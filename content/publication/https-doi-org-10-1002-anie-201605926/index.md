abstract: Abstract Low-energy density has long been the major limitation to the application
  of supercapacitors. Introducing topological defects and dopants in carbon-based
  electrodes in a supercapacitor improves the performance by maximizing the gravimetric
  capacitance per mass of the electrode. However, the main mechanisms governing this
  capacitance improvement are still unclear. We fabricated planar electrodes from
  CVD-derived single-layer graphene with deliberately introduced topological defects
  and nitrogen dopants in controlled concentrations and of known configurations, to
  estimate the influence of these defects on the electrical double-layer (EDL) capacitance.
  Our experimental study and theoretical calculations show that the increase in EDL
  capacitance due to either the topological defects or the nitrogen dopants has the
  same origin, yet these two factors improve the EDL capacitance in different ways.
  Our work provides a better understanding of the correlation between the atomic-scale
  structure and the EDL capacitance and presents a new strategy for the development
  of experimental and theoretical models for understanding the EDL capacitance of
  carbon electrodes.
