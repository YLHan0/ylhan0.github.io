abstract: Since the first report on single-layer MoS2 based transistor, rapid progress
  has been achieved in two-dimensional (2D) material-based atomically thin electronics,
  providing an alternative approach to solve the bottleneck in silicon device miniaturization.
  In this scenario, reliable contact between the metal electrodes and the subnanometer-thick
  2D materials becomes crucial in determining the device performance. Here, utilizing
  the quasi-van der Waals (vdW) epitaxy of metals on fluorophlogopite mica, we demonstrate
  an all-stacking method for the fabrication of 2D devices with high-quality vdW contacts
  by mechanically transferring pre-deposited metal electrodes. This technique is applicable
  for complex device integration with sizes up to the wafer scale and is also capable
  of tuning the electric characteristics of the interfacial junctions by transferring
  selective metals. Our results provide an efficient, scalable, and low-cost technique
  for 2D electronics, allowing high-density device integration as well as a handy
  tool for fundamental research in vdW materials.
