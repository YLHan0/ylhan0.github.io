abstract: Abstract Insufficient limit of detection (LoD) toward volatile organic compounds
  (VOCs) hinders the promising applications of metal oxide chemiresistors in emerging
  air quality monitoring and/or breath analysis. There is an inherent limitation of
  widely adopted strategies of creating sensitive chemiresistors then operating at
  the optimized temperature via a continuous heating (CH) mode. Herein, a strategy
  combining Pt single atoms anchoring (chemical sensitization) with pulsed temperature
  modulation (PTM, physical sensitization) is proposed. Apart from generating abundant
  surface asymmetric oxygen vacancy (Pt-VO-W) active sites at pulsed high temperature
  (HT) stage, inward diffusion of trace target VOCs across the sensing layer at pulsed
  low temperature stage (driven by PTM induced concentration gradient), can greatly
  enhance the charge interaction probability between the generated surface active
  species and the surrounding VOCs, and thus offers a novel avenue on addressing the
  bottleneck issue of low LoD by PTM. Triggered by HT of 300 °C, the responses of
  Pt anchored WO3 chemiresistor to 1 ppm trimethylamine (TMA) and xylene can be drastically
  boosted from 1.9 (CH) to 6541.5 (PTM) and 1.5 (CH) to 1001.1 (PTM), respectively.
  And ultra-low theoretic LoD of 0.78 ppt (TMA) and 0.18 ppt (xylene) are successfully
  achieved, respectively.
