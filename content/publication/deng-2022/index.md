abstract: Topological surface states are a new class of electronic states with novel
  properties, including the potential for annihilation between surface states from
  two topological insulators at a common interface. Here, we report the annihilation
  and creation of topological surface states in the SnTe/Crx(BiSb)2--xTe3 (CBST) heterostructures
  as evidenced by magneto-transport, polarized neutron reflectometry, and first-principles
  calculations. Our results show that topological surface states are induced in the
  otherwise topologically trivial two-quintuple-layers thick CBST when interfaced
  with SnTe, as a result of the surface state annihilation at the SnTe/CBST interface.
  Moreover, we unveiled systematic changes in the transport behaviors of the heterostructures
  with respect to changing Fermi level and thickness. Our observation of surface state
  creation and annihilation demonstrates a promising way of designing and engineering
  topological surface states for dissipationless electronics.
