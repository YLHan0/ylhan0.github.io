abstract: Van Hove singularity (VHS) has been considered as a driving source for unconventional
  superconductivity. A VHS in two-dimensional (2D) materials consists of a saddle
  point connecting electron-like and hole-like bands. In a rare case, when a VHS appears
  at Fermi level, both electron-like and hole-like conduction can coexist, giving
  rise to an enhanced density of states as well as an attractive component of Coulomb
  interaction for unconventional electronic pairing. However, this van Hove scenario
  is often destroyed by an incorrect chemical potential or competing instabilities.
  Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission measurements, we report the observation
  of a VHS perfectly aligned with the Fermi level in a kagome superconductor CsV3-xTaxSb5
  (xþinspace~þinspace0.4), in which a record-high superconducting transition temperature
  is achieved among all the current variants of AV3Sb5 (Aþinspace=þinspaceCs, Rb,
  K) at ambient pressure. Doping dependent measurements reveal the important role
  of van Hove scenario in boosting superconductivity, and spectroscopic-imaging scanning
  tunneling microscopy measurements indicate a distinct superconducting state in this
  system.
